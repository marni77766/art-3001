    <p>Talking about how life was when the internet was just becoming popular is weird. Watching the commercials that were meant to inform people about internet etiquette and such feels like a different world. It seems insane that at one point people needed to be convinced that the internet is useful. </p><br>
    <p>The expectations people had for the internet when it first became popular seem so naive, like "it's going to make my life so much easier and save me so much time". Honestly, they had no idea what they were getting into. Some days I am simply unable to get off of my phone and do things that I need to do. I feel like there are so many problems that I (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) have because of the internet that would not exist otherwise. The internet has created an entirely new world, and it's very complicated, but also very fun. One minute Bernie Sanders arrives at the 2021 inauguration dressed as casual as possible and the next minute my twitter feed is filled with the memes of him socially distanced, sitting cross legged on a chair looking like this was just one of the errands on his to do list for the day. Memes are one of the best results of the popularization of the internet. Some days I would not survive without my favorite meme pages. It's comforting to know that there are all of these people out there that like the same kind of memes as you. I love that there are so may different groups of people that you can connect with via the internet since it is so easy to access info about the kind of things that you like. Meme pages are a great example of that. Also, reddit. I feel like searching a question on reddit is the next best thing to just asking a friend, giving you honest and helpful answers. </p>
