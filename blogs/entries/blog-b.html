    <p>This past week has been a little depressing. In class we were talking about drone pilots being able to blur out
        their victims as they are killed. It's pretty obvious but the world is kinda bleak :(. </p>
    <p>Discussing GUI was pretty interesting. Someone pointed out that over the years, iphone apps have progressively
        gotten less realistic looking. The first instagram app looked like this <br> <br> <img
            src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3bc9172835d547edcf6dfd63f716522e" width="5%" height="5%"> <br>
        and now it looks like this <br> <img
            src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxoXuOloftrhnVun9zGrpHGxpfg=/128x0:896x512/1400x1400/filters:focal(128x0:896x512):format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49569867/CiLjMbBUoAAOsFi.0.0.jpg"
            width="7%" height="7%"> <br> We are venturing further and further away from reality every day, which is
        honestly kinda cool i guess.</p>
    <br>
    <p>anyways here are some cute gifs that have made this week better for me :)</p>
