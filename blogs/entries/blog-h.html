    <h3>blog h :)</h3>
    <p class="blog-h">It is getting so hard to concentrate on school.
        It's finally getting warm out and I don't want to be inside. This winter
        was extremely depressing. Winter is already pretty bad for me and 
        im sure so many other people but covid made everything so much worse. I literally 
        did not see anyone besides my boyfriend, who i live with, for at least a few months.
        Recently I've been hanging out with my friends though and I feel so much better.

    <p class="blog-h">So with all of this being said I really do not have much
        to say about class :(

    <p class="blog-h">Mimo is continuing to help me sooo much regarding CSS layouts.
        I need to rewatch a lot of the lectures but using this app in addition makes everything
        make more sense to me.
        I had a really hard time with the layout of my homepage for exercise 4, but after
        a few lessons with CSS layouts I feel like I'm ready to try it again. I think my homepage for this website
        will be pretty cool. I don't think I'm able to make it exactly how I want to yet, as 
        I barely know any javascript.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-h">I need to learn more javascript I cannot wait until I am finally good at it!!!! will be so cool :)</p>
