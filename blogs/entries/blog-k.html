        <p>i had a really good spring break and kind of forgot that school existed.
            im not usually extremely social but i hungout with my friends almost everyday and it was very refreshing!! i now feel like im somewhat 
            more willing to do school work now lol

        <p>ive been really into riding my bike lately and it has made my life so much better.
            i love spring so much. warm weather makes me so happy and it smells so good outside!!! except i always forget
            that i have seasonal allergies. last night on my drive home from work my vision was literally blurry from my eyes burning 
            so bad so that was fun

        <p>my best friend is working on a documentary that just had its debut on Netflix so we watched that 
            the other night. It was so so so good (it's called Coded Bias) but alos extremely depresseing. It's basically about
            how facial recognition has been mainly produced by white men and how this creates a lot of inequalities within the technology itself. There were 
        a few instances where the facial recognition device would not register someone's face because they were black. I feel like i need to rewatch it cause i forget some of the other stuff mentioned.
