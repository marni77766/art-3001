    <p>Winter is finally almost over :)
        <br>
        I've been watching thecodingtrain tutorials this past week and 
        javascript is finally starting to make some sense to me. I'm excited
        to keep learning more about it and use it in my website. As of now I 
        want to create little 'sketches' with javascript and eventually add them into my homepage,
        maybe taking the place of text (instead of having titles for each box- illustrations,
         animations, etc). 
         <br>
         Last night I finished a tiny little <a href="winter.html">animation</a> that I have been working on for the past couple weeks
