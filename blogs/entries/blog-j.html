    <p class="blog-i">i am so excited to have a break this week!!! i also don't have to work that much this week
        so i'm very happy 
    </p>
    <p class="blog-i">my exercise 4 is going kind of well i think. i feel confident that i will
        be able to get the layout right, i just need to figure out hwat else i am going to add because right now all 
        i have is the blobs that are floating around that took forever to make as i'm not that great at using illustrator yet.
        i cannot wait for this semester to be over. hopefully i will be able to graduate soon, although i still need to get
        an internship and am a little scared about that because i don't really know where to start!!!
    </p>
    <p class="blog-i">hopefully i will be able to get a lot of work done during this week that i have off :) 
        i have a lot i want to do with my homepage and stuff that i haven't gotten around to yet
    </p>
