    <p>My head hurts!!!! I have so much to do!!!!! Coding is hard!!!!</p>
    <p>Yesterday was my first birthday during covid, which was a little sad but nonetheless it was fine, except I fell asleep at 9pm (really embarrassing but oh well).</p>
    <p>I'm so excited to work more on my homepage!! Hopefully it will look really cute as that's kinda my only goal for it at the moment.. I really don't even know where to start with adding javascript so I think I'm going to watch some tutorials and go from there.</p>
    <p>I'm pretty technologically challenged so it took me quite awhile to figure out how to download and convert fonts from the internet into my website but <div style="font-family: 'Monster Friend Fore', monospace; color: black;">HERE IS A REALLY CUTE PIXEL FONT THAT I FOUND :)</div></p>
