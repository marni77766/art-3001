    <h3>blog i <3</h3>
    <p class="blog-i">This past week my group presented on memes, fake news, and virality. The video I watched was super interesting although i feel like i need
        to rewatch it again to understand it better. Getting news from youtube is bad. the conpiracy theory content
        on youtube is kinda scary. it's scary that so many young people are dragged into them by not knowing
        any better. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog-i">every few months i get super overwhelmed about the fact that i am still in school and do not know when i will be graduating for sure.
        i love taking art classes, especially this one, but i hate that i don't have a lot of time to do my work. i wish i didn't have to have a job lol
    </p>
    <p class="blog-i">with that being said, lately i have felt like i really want to be a graphic designer. i feel like i have said this before 
        and still have not had much time to teach myself some stuff regarding it. hopefully it is something that is easy to learn on your own because i don't think
        i can handle anymore school after i graduate
