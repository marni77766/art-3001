    <h3>blog g</h3>
    <p>We just finished looking at everyone's homepage!! Everyone did a great job and it was so fun getting to see everyone's work :)
    </p>
    <p>After looking at everyone's work, I've realized that there are a lot more
        things I want to add to my homepage, and I have also realized that I will probab;y be working on 
        it for quite awhile longer.

    <p>We had a presentation today about crowds, labor, and the gig economy. We spent some time talking
        about how automation has been affected by the pandemic
