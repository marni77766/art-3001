    <h3>blog g</h3>
    <p>We just finished looking at everyone's homepage!! Everyone did a great job and it was so fun getting to see everyone's work :)
    </p>
    <p>After looking at everyone's work, I've realized that there are a lot more
        things I want to add to my homepage, and I have also realized that I will probably be working on 
        it for quite awhile longer. I want to work on the responsiveness of my website.. right now it really does not work on a phone 
        and I would like to fix that so I can actually use it as a portfolio for all of my work :)
    </p>
    <p>We had a presentation today about crowds, labor, and the gig economy. We spent some time talking
        about how automation has increased because of the pandemic, which was super interesting and also made me think about this video I watched
        awhile ago about this restaurant in California that has a robot deliver their food to customers lollll. Sometimes I already feel like
        a robot at my serving job :( Someone also mentioned the fact that food service workers could be one day replaced by robots (which is right now 
        highly unlikely thank god)
