        It's been fun learning more javascript lately. I've been watching thecodingtrain videos
        and they are extremely helpful. I hope to learn as much as I can in the next week in order
        to finish my homepage for project 1. I think I really need to look at more examples 
        for inspiration, as right now I feel a little lost with designing.

        I came across on are.na a couple days ago that I thought was cool.

        That website really makes me want to learn how to use Cinema 4D or Blender. That's one of
        my goals for the summer that hopefully I will do. I've been really interested in 3d animation
        for a bit now, but haven't had much time to learn how to use these programs during school
        and with work. Looking at all of the other Art + Tech classes that OSU offers is also super 
        motivating. All of them sound so cool, hopefully I will have time to take a good  amount of them.

        A bit ago I came across this artist who makes 3d makeup. Her name is @ines.alpha on instagram :)
