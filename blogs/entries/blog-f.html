    <h3>blog f</h3>
    <p class="box">This week has mostly consisted of working on my homepage!! I didn't have much of a plan for it to begin with, other than the mock-up that I put together a couple weeks ago.
        I mostly just winged it, but I think the main source of inspiration was the color palette that I chose. I wanted my homepage to be very bright and cute, with the 
        other pages (animations/gifs, projects, blogs, etc.) being darker. I think I really like how that transition turned out. I spent some time making the background in Illustrator- 
        using the mesh tool to make some colorful blobs. I wanted to make the colors look like they are moving so I tried to make a gif, but it didn't turn out the way I wanted to so I just
        sped it up and the result was a little nauseating apparently but I think it looks cool.
